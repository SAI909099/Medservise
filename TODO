🔧 Recommended Features to Add Next
1. Patient Queue View per Doctor


✅ Each doctor sees their queue of patients.

➕ Add the ability to:

View patient info

Mark a patient as “In Progress”, “Treated”, or “Skipped”

Assign a patient to a treatment room

2. Treatment Room Assignment Logic
From the Doctor Dashboard or Reception, allow assigning a free room to a patient.

Show which doctor is using which room, and automatically free up the room when treatment is done.

📋 Admin Features (for Clinic Managers)
3. Admin Dashboard
List of all:

Doctors

Patients

Rooms

Appointments or Visits

Add/Edit/Delete doctors and treatment rooms

View reports like:

Number of patients per doctor

Room utilization

Daily registration logs

👨‍⚕️ Doctor Features
4. Doctor Treatment View
Show:

Patient reason

Visit date/time

History of visits (optional)

Allow the doctor to:

Write treatment notes

Prescribe medication (optional)

Mark patient as “Treated”

📁 Patient History (optional but useful)
Maintain a simple record of past visits per patient

Can be useful for follow-ups or ongoing conditions

🔐 Authentication and Role-Based Access (if not already done)
Use JWT or session auth

Roles:

receptionist (only registration and room control)

doctor (only their queue and patients)

admin (all access)

🌐 Optional Extras (for production-ready app)
✅ Responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind

🔍 Search/filter patients or doctors

📦 Export reports as PDF or Excel

🔔 Notifications for doctors when a new patient is assigned

Suggested Next Step for You
✅ Since you already have doctor and registration sides, your next practical feature might be:

Doctor queue + patient detail view + room assignment

Let me know which one you’d like to build next — I can help step-by-step with Django APIs, Bootstrap UI, and JavaScript for the frontend.
